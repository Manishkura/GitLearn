 
========================= A Small Note Before You Get Started =================================

Hello mate! I am Ritheesh Baradwaj. I made this tool so that one can know the importance of Git 

and learn Git commands. I personally benefited a lot by using Git and GitHub. I hope, this 

application will help you.

I have used many online resources while creating the application and I would like to thank them.

As I'm also in a learning stage, I would like to know your feedback and suggestions as well. 

So please contact me at: bunnyrb4@gmail.com. 

I'll definitely try to improve the  application based on your feedback.

NOTE: DO NOT make any changes in the folder. For more information on how to use the application,
